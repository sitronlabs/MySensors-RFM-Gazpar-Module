It integrates into a lot of [controllers](https://www.mysensors.org/controller) (Home Assistant, Jeedom, Domoticz, and more) so you can easily connect custom made devices into your existing home automation setup.

### Product description
This module plugs into french Gazpar gas meters to keep track of the volume of gas consummed in real time. Gazpar meters send a pulse every 0.01 m³ (10 L) which is detected by this module.

### Features
- Designed for [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) with a RFM69 or RFM95/96 (LoRa) radio
- Battery powered
- Comes with a cable for interfacing with the Gazpar gas meter
- Opensource firmware
- USB port for debugging and firmware update

### Known limitations
With the current firmware, the battery will last probably last around a month before needing to be recharged. The next firmware update will try to improve efficiency, in order to last at least 3 months.

### Disclaimer
This module has been designed with thoughts and consideration, but does not come with any certification. Only CE and ATEX certified devices should be installed next to the gas meter. Use it at your own risk.
